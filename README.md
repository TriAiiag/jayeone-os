# 🌳 Vriksha-OS (by TriAiiag)
**The Intelligent Operating System for Natural & Vrikshayurvedic Farming.**

**Mission:** To digitize 2,500 years of Indian plant wisdom into a scalable AI engine that solves crop diseases using local, organic resources.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
Vriksha-OS is built on a **Master-Apprentice (Teacher-Student) framework**:
1. **Acharya (The Teacher):** Powered by Gemini 3 Flash. High-level diagnosis and "Synthetic Wisdom" extraction from ancient texts and YouTube.
2. **Shishya (The Student):** A custom, lightweight ML model designed to run locally on the farm once trained on 1,000+ verified rows.

---

## 🚦 Roadmap: The Foundation Phase (Phase 1)
* [ ] **API Failover Rotator:** Automated switching between 10 Google Cloud Projects to ensure zero downtime.
* [ ] **Assembly Line Folders:** * `/Tri_Pending`: Raw field audits.
    * `/Tri_Training_Data`: Verified, AI-labeled "Gold" data.
* [ ] **Jala-Check (Water Lab):** Logic for Bubble/Limescale analysis to correct prescriptions for hard water.

---

## 🏷️ The Data Value Chain
Every row in our database is tagged by **Source** to ensure 100% traceability for international buyers:
* **Field-Real:** Audits from Jayeone Farms & partners. (Highest Value)
* **Scrape-Verified:** Wisdom from "Shruti" (YouTube Scraper) matched against Vriksha PDFs.
* **Synthetic-AI:** Logic scenarios generated to bridge the gap for rare diseases.

*Built in Anantapur, India. Scaling for the World.*
