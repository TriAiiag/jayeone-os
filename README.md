# 📜 TriAiiag OS: Master Blueprint
**Bridging Ancient Vrikshayurveda with Modern AI Intelligence** **Version:** 1.0.0 (Foundation Phase)  
**Founder:** [Your Name]

## 🛠 1. Project Overview
TriAiiag OS is a specialized agricultural intelligence system designed to provide natural and organic farming prescriptions based on Vrikshayurveda. It utilizes a **Teacher-Student** model to scale expert knowledge while remaining affordable and accessible to local farmers.

## 🚀 2. Feature Roadmap (Teacher & Student)

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Current Status)**
- [ ] **API Failover Rotator:** Automated switching between 5–10 Google Cloud Project keys to ensure zero downtime (prevents `429 Busy` errors).
- [ ] **Assembly Line Folders:**
  - `TriAiiag_Pending`: Temporary storage for raw farm uploads.
  - `TriAiiag_Training_Data`: Organized, AI-labeled repository for model training.
- [ ] **Vriksha Knowledge Hub:** Central database of verified remedies (Neem, Milk, Bitter Plants) for cross-referencing AI advice.

### **Phase 2: Field Intelligence (Field App)**
- [ ] **Field WebApp:** 1-click mobile interface for capturing disease photos and farm data.
- [ ] **Mobile Water Lab:** AI-powered "Bubble Test" (video) and "Limescale Scan" (photo) to assess water quality.
- [ ] **GPS/Soil Integration:** Automatic soil-type tagging (Red, Black, Alluvial, Laterite) based on real-time location.
- [ ] **Dynamic Pharmacy:** Inventory checklist that adapts based on the detected disease (e.g., asking for Cinnamon only if Root Rot is found).

### **Phase 3: The Learning Loop**
- [ ] **YouTube Scraper:** Automated transcript extraction and **Comment Sentiment Analysis** to find "community-verified" hidden gems.
- [ ] **Synthetic Row Linker:** Connecting YouTube "Text Wisdom" with existing library "Visual Photos."
- [ ] **The Judge Dashboard:** Interface for the Founder to Approve, Edit, or Discard AI prescriptions based on confidence scores.
- [ ] **Visual Recovery Bot:** WhatsApp follow-up reminders to capture "After" photos and auto-verify successful treatments.

## 🏷 3. Data Integrity & Tagging Strategy
To build a high-value asset for global buyers, every data row is tagged by its source:
1. **Field-Real:** Highest value. Data captured from actual farm audits (Jayeone Farms).
2. **Scrape-Verified:** Wisdom extracted from YouTube and matched against Vrikshayurveda PDFs.
3. **Synthetic-AI:** Logic-based scenarios generated to train the Student model on unseen diseases.

---

## 🛡 4. System Guardrails
- **The 85% Confidence Rule:** If the Student Model confidence is below 85%, the system automatically falls back to the Teacher (Gemini 3 Flash).
- **Water Salinity Correction:** The system modifies prescriptions based on water hardness (e.g., replacing Milk with Buttermilk in salty conditions).
- **Scientific Verification:** Scraped remedies are "Peer Reviewed" by the AI against Vrikshayurvedic principles before entering the training set.

## 📈 5. Scaling Strategy
1. **Foundation:** Solidify API rotation and folder automation.
2. **Collection:** Hit the **1,000-row goal** of high-quality, verified data.
3. **Distillation:** Train the Student model in Google Colab to run locally/offline.
4. **Expansion:** Partner with other farmers to collect global soil-type data.
